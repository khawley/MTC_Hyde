Mt. Cross Ministries' main site is located in the coastal redwood forest of the Santa Cruz Mountains, 20 minutes from the Santa Cruz beaches. Mt. Cross  offers summer camp and retreat opportunities for all ages. Most Mt. Cross directed camps are on the main site and many, like Day Camps, take place in communities all over northern California.

Churches, schools, clubs and other organizations use Mt. Cross as their group retreat center by utilizing the Outdoor Conference Center (OCC). Mt. Cross provides facilities, meal service and program support (as desired) to  make your group's experience as successful as possible. Many groups take advantage of the Challenge Course and/or climbing tower.

Established in 1948, Mt. Cross has a unique **[history][historyHome]** in Northern California.
